;; #Pallet
;; 
;; Pallet is a package-management tool for Emacs.
;; 
;; It uses rejeep's excellent
;; [Cask](https://github.com/rejeep/cask.el) as a platform to keep
;; track of your installed packages.
;; 
;; ##Target platform
;; 
;; Pallet is well tested on Emacs 24.3.1, and should work on
;; previous versions of Emacs 24. Emacs snapshot is at present making
;; changes to the package system which will prevent Pallet from working correctly.
;; 
;; ##Installation
;; 
;; To install Pallet, you should first install Cask, following the
;; instructions [here](https://github.com/rejeep/cask.el). **At present,
;; just install Cask -- don't add anything to your .emacs or init.el file**.
;; 
;; After installing Cask, there are two ways you can go, depending on
;; your situation:
;; 
;; 1. **I have a working Emacs install, with packages already installed,
;;    and can access [MELPA](http://melpa.milbox.org).**
;; 
;;    In this case run `M-x list-packages`, and install Pallet. Then, below
;;    the lines which initialize your package system, add:
;; 
;;    ```lisp
;;    (require 'pallet)
;;    ```
;; 
;;    Restart Emacs, and run `pallet-init`. Now you have a Cask file in your
;;    emacs.d directory which contains listings for all files you've
;;    previously installed via `package-install`, and your .emacs.d/elpa
;;    directory has been replicated under .emacs.d/.cask/.
;; 
;;    You can if you wish now delete your .emacs.d/elpa directory, and
;;    remove any lines from your init.el adding archives to
;;    `package-archive`, or running `package-initialize`.
;; 
;; 2. **I have a newly installed Emacs and/or am not set up to use
;;    package-install.**
;; 
;;    In this case, create a file called `Cask` in your emacs.d
;;    directory. Add the following lines to it:
;; 
;;    ```lisp
;;    (source melpa)
;; 
;;    (depends-on "pallet")
;;    ```
;; 
;;    Then, in terminal and in your emacs.d directory, run
;; 
;;    ```
;;    cask install
;;    ```
;; 
;;    This will create a `.cask` directory inside your .emacs.d directory,
;;    initialize a package directory under .emacs.d/.cask/, and install
;;    Pallet to it.
;; 
;; **Finally, make sure the following lines are in your init.el, before any
;;   packages are required:**
;; 
;; ```lisp
;; (require 'cask "~/.cask/cask.el")
;; (cask-initialize)
;; (require 'pallet)
;; ```
;; 
;; ##What problem does Pallet solve?
;; 
;; You are an Emacs user, and you use package.el to maintain a set of
;; installed packages, via the Elpa archive (and/or Melpa, Marmalade,
;; whatever). You use Emacs at more than one site or on more than one
;; machine, and you want to use the same packages with each Emacs
;; installation.
;; 
;; The standard way of synchronising settings among Emacs installs is to
;; keep your emacs.d directory under version control, perhaps using
;; Git. That way, you can simply push your settings to a repo when they
;; change, and pull them at another site. This way of working also works
;; with the `/elpa` subdirectory of emacs.d, keeping your installed
;; packages in a versioned repository.
;; 
;; ###Package management
;; 
;; Working this way with the `/elpa` directory quickly becomes a chore,
;; though. The directory can become large and complex, and you can
;; encounter merge conflicts when trying to synchronise it across Emacs
;; installs. The solution is a dependency management system (like Ruby's
;; [Bundler](http://gembundler.com), for example) which allows you to
;; keep one 'manifest' file under version control, and ignore the
;; *actual* installed packages; the manifest file lists packages and
;; versions, and the dependency manager can install and update the listed
;; packages whenever required to.
;; 
;; ###Cask
;; 
;; [Cask](https://github.com/rejeep/cask.el) is a dependency manager
;; for Emacs, which is gaining currency especially in new Elisp
;; projects. It provides a simple format for creating manifest files, and
;; a set of functionality to install and update packages (as well as some
;; very useful utilities for package *development*).
;; 
;; The piece missing from Cask is the functionality to create and
;; maintain a manifest file *in tandem* with package.el, Emacs' built-in
;; package system.
;; 
;; You can, of course, manually maintain your Cask (manifest) file, but
;; most of us like to use `M-x package-list-packages` to discover and
;; install packages. Pallet lets you do exactly this.
;; 
;; ##How does it work?
;; 
;; First, you need to install Pallet (see above).
;; 
;; `M-x pallet-init` will look at your installed packages and source
;; archives and create a valid Cask file in your Emacs directory. You
;; now no longer need to keep your `/elpa` directory under version
;; control (in fact, you can delete it as Cask will now manage your
;; packages for you); simply keep your Cask file under version control, and use
;; Cask and Pallet to keep your packages synchronised across Emacs
;; installs. Pallet will update your Cask file when you add or delete packages via
;; `list-packages`.
;; 
;; ##Alternatives
;; 
;; [el-get](https://github.com/dimitri/el-get) is a popular and
;; feature-packed project which does much more than Pallet. Pallet just
;; tries to do one simple thing well enough.
;;
;;; Code:

;; We need to get a copy of the package-archives alist
;; before requiring Cask, as doing so will empty the list.
