# Lee's Emacs environment

This is my Emacs environment, such as it is. It was originally based off of [Setting up Emacs as Ruby development environment on OS X](http://crypt.codemancers.com/posts/2013-09-26-setting-up-emacs-as-development-environment-on-osx/) but I've since added a number of tweaks and configurations that I've picked up from a lot of other places.

## Prerequisites

1. `brew install the_silver_searcher`
1. `brew install aspell --with-lang-en`
