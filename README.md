# Lee's Emacs environment

This is my Emacs environment, such as it is. It is almost completely based off of [Setting up Emacs as Ruby development environment on OSX](http://crypt.codemancers.com/posts/2013-09-26-setting-up-emacs-as-development-environment-on-osx/).

## Prerequisites

1. `brew install the_silver_searcher`
1. `brew install aspell --with-lang-en`
